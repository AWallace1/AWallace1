      <h2><strong>Kinetiq Profitability Analysis</strong></h2>
      <p><strong>Kinetiq is a global electronics retailer established in 2016 that sells a wide range of consumer electronics through both online channels and physical store locations. This project analyzes company performance through a profit-focused lens to understand which products, customer segments, and geographic regions drive the highest profitability and how these trends have evolved over time. Using historical sales, customer, and store data, the analysis uncovers key seasonal patterns, identifies top and underperforming product categories, and evaluates the relative contribution of online versus in-store sales. The findings are translated into actionable recommendations to support data-driven decisions across marketing strategy, product planning, and store optimization.</strong></p>
